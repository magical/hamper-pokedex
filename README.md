Installation
------------

The following steps assume that your database is `postgresql:///pokedex` and
your lookup index directory is `./dex-lookup`.

1. Install Whoosh version 2.5. (Pokedex doesn't work with the latest version of whoosh)

        $ pip install Whoosh==2.5.6

2. Run `python setup.py install`

   This will also install the [pokedex][] library.

   initialize the pokemon database and search index.
